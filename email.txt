As discussed, here is the code test:

The coding exercise can be downloaded from the following link https://flexerasoftware.box.com/s/u6y04hlz17z6qglxa20djl4zw78gib6j

    This test is to assess your ability to write world class production code that would be included in our Flexera products
    Please write this code to the standard you would expect of a world class product
    Please write your tests to the level that you would expect to write for production code
    Please imagine this assignment is a small part of a larger product, and include the degree of OO modelling you would expect to include if this assignment was part of your work at Flexera
    Please design and write this code to cover the full set of non-functional concerns you would expect from a software product with high quality

Feel free to ignore the AWS architecture question, if you donâ€™t feel up to it.
